## Description

Users who are set as subscription owners are able to make administrative changes to the subscriptions and move them into and out of Microsoft Entra ID.

Permissions to move subscriptions in and out of Microsoft Entra ID must only be given to appropriate administrative personnel. A subscription that is moved into an Microsoft Entra ID may be within a folder to which other users have elevated permissions. This prevents loss of data or unapproved changes of the objects within by potential bad actors.
