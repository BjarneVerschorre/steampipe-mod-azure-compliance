## Overview

The federal government is committed to modernizing its digital infrastructure, including the way it uses, shares and stores data. A cornerstone feature of this transformation is an increased reliance on modern cloud technologies. However, concerns related to security are commonly cited when migrating to cloud-based products and services. In response to these concerns, the FedRAMP program began in 2011, designed to verify that CSPs serving the federal government meet established security criteria. This government-wide program provides a standardized framework for conducting security assessments, authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

FedRAMP High is reserved for highly sensitive, unclassified data. The program also includes two lower levels of authorization: Low and Moderate. Each one has its own security control requirements based on the sensitivity of the data that falls within that level. Low impact level systems have 125 controls, moderate impact level systems have 325 controls and high impact level systems require 421 controls. These security controls are divided into 17 control families such as Access Control (AC), Audit and Accountability (AU), Personnel Security (PS), Risk Assessment (RA), Contingency Planning (CP), and Incident Response (IR).

## FedRAMP Security Objectives

FedRAMP categorizes providers by the level of authorization they have achieved. It also organizes them across three broad security objectives: confidentiality, integrity and availability. 

- Confidentiality: Adequate safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorized access to personal or proprietary data. 

- Integrity: Stored data is appropriately protected, preventing its modification or destruction.

- Availability: Secure data is ready when it is needed; the systems are tasked with providing data access continuously.
