## Description

A Diagnostic Setting must exist. If a Diagnostic Setting does not exist, the navigation and options within this recommendation will not be available. Please review the recommendation at the beginning of this subsection titled: "Ensure that a 'Diagnostic Setting' exists."
The diagnostic setting should be configured to log the appropriate activities from the control/management plane.

A diagnostic setting controls how the diagnostic log is exported. Capturing the diagnostic setting categories for appropriate control/management plane activities allows proper alerting.
