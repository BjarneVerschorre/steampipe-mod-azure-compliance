## Description

Network security groups should be periodically evaluated for port misconfigurations. Where certain ports and protocols may be exposed to the Internet, they should be evaluated for necessity and restricted wherever they are not explicitly required and narrowly configured.

The potential security problem with using HTTP(S) over the Internet is that attackers can use various brute force techniques to gain access to Azure resources. Once the attackers gain access, they can use the resource as a launch point for compromising other resources within the Azure tenant.

## Remediation

Disable direct  access to your Azure Virtual Machines from the Internet. After direct HTTP(S) access from the Internet is disabled, you have other options you can use to access these virtual machines for remote management:

1. [Point-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal)
1. [Site-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal)
1. [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/)

**Note:** By default, HTTP(S) access from internet is not enabled.
