## Description

Turning on firewall rules for storage account will block access to incoming requests for data, including from other Azure services. We can re-enable this functionality by enabling "Trusted Azure Services" through networking exceptions.

## Remediation

### From Azure Console

  1. Go to `Storage Accounts`
  2. For each storage account, Click on the `Networking` blade
  3. Click on the `Firewalls and virtual networks` heading.
  4. Ensure that `Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses` is selected.
  5. Under the 'Exceptions' label, enable check box for `Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account.`
  6. Click Save to apply your changes.

### From Azure CLI

Use the below command to update Azure services.

```bash
az storage account update --name <StorageAccountName> --resource-group
<resourceGroupName> --bypass AzureServices
```

### Default Value:

By default, Storage Accounts will accept connections from clients on any network.
