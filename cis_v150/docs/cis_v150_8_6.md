## Description

Role assignments disappear when a Key Vault has been deleted (soft- delete) and recovered. Afterwards it will be required to recreate all role assignments. This is a limitation of the soft-delete feature across all Azure services.

The new RBAC permissions model for Key Vaults enables a much finer grained access control for key vault secrets, keys, certificates, etc., than the vault access policy. This in turn will permit the use of privileged identity management over these roles, thus securing the key vaults with JIT Access management.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login and go to `Key vaults`.
2. Select the desired `Key vault`.
3. Go to `Objects` section and click on `Keys`.
3. Set the `Permission Model radio button` to `Azure role-based`.

Select the Role Assignments in the horizontal row and reapply permissions as needed to groups or users.
