## Description

Guest users in the Azure AD are generally required for collaboration purposes in Office 365, and may also be required for Azure functions in enterprises with multiple Azure tenants. Guest users should be reviewed on a regular basis, at least annually. Guest users should not be granted administrative roles where possible.

Guest users are typically added outside your employee on-boarding/off-boarding process and could potentially be overlooked indefinitely, leading to a potential vulnerability.

Guest users should be reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure that inactive and unneeded accounts are removed.
