## Description

TLS 1.0 has known vulnerabilities and has been replaced by later versions of the TLS protocol. Continued use of this legacy protocol affects the security of data in transit.

## Remediation

  2. Go to `Storage Accounts`
  3. Click on each Storage Account

```bash
Set-AzStorageAccount -AccountName <STORAGEACCOUNTNAME> `
 -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCEGROUPNAME> `
-MinimumTlsVersion TLS1_2
