## Description

Security defaults provide secure default settings that we manage on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.
For example, doing the following:
  • Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.
  • Challenging users with MFA - mostly when they show up on a new device or app, but more often for critical roles and tasks.
  • Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which can’t do MFA.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

  1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
  2. Browse to `Azure Active Directory > Properties`
  3. Select `Manage security defaults`
  4. Set the `Enable security defaults toggle to Yes`
  5. Select `Save`

Please note that at this point of time, there is no Azure CLI or other API commands available to programmatically conduct security configuration for this recommendation.

### Default Value:

If your tenant was created on or after October 22, 2019, security defaults may already be enabled in your tenant.
