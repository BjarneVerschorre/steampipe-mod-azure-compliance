## Description

Enabling this gives your organization further customization on what secure passwords are allowed. Setting a bad password list enables your organization to fine-tune its password policy further, depending on your needs. Removing easy-to-guess passwords increases the security of access to your Azure resources.

## Remediation

### From Azure Portal

  1. From Azure Home select the Portal Menu
  2. Select `Azure Active Directory` in the menu that opens, and then `Security`.
  3. Under `Management` select `Authentication`, then `Password Protection`.
  4. Set the `Enforce custom list` to `Yes.`
  5. Double click the custom password list to add a string.

Please note that at this point of time, there is no Azure CLI or other API commands available to programmatically conduct security configuration for this recommendation.
